# AWS Plugin for Tailpipe

[Tailpipe](https://tailpipe.io) is an open-source CLI tool that allows you to collect logs and query them with SQL.

[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to authenticated customers on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.

The [AWS Plugin for Tailpipe](https://hub.tailpipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws) allows you to collect and query AWS logs using SQL to track activity, monitor trends, detect anomalies, and more!

## Getting Started

Install Tailpipe from the [downloads](https://tailpipe.io/downloads) page:

```sh
# MacOS
brew install turbot/tap/tailpipe
```

```sh
# Linux or Windows (WSL)
sudo /bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://tailpipe.io/install/tailpipe.sh)"
```

Install the plugin:

```sh
tailpipe plugin install aws
```

Configure your [connection credentials](https://hub.tailpipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws#connection-credentials), table partition, and data source ([examples](https://hub.tailpipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/tables/aws_cloudtrail_log#example-configurations)):

```sh
vi ~/.tailpipe/config/aws.tpc
```

```hcl
connection "aws" "logging_account" {
  profile = "my-logging-account"
}

partition "aws_cloudtrail_log" "my_logs" {
  source "aws_s3_bucket" {
    connection = connection.aws.logging_account
    bucket     = "aws-cloudtrail-logs-bucket"
  }
}
```

Download, enrich, and save logs from your source ([examples](https://tailpipe.io/docs/reference/cli/collect)):

```sh
tailpipe collect aws_cloudtrail_log
```

Enter interactive query mode:

```sh
tailpipe query
```

Run a query:

```sql
select
  event_source,
  event_name,
  count(*) as event_count
from
  aws_cloudtrail_log
where
  not read_only
group by
  event_source,
  event_name
order by
  event_count desc;
```

```sh
+----------------------+-----------------------+-------------+
| event_source         | event_name            | event_count |
+----------------------+-----------------------+-------------+
| logs.amazonaws.com   | CreateLogStream       | 793845      |
| ecs.amazonaws.com    | RunTask               | 350836      |
| ecs.amazonaws.com    | SubmitTaskStateChange | 190185      |
| s3.amazonaws.com     | PutObject             | 60842       |
| sns.amazonaws.com    | TagResource           | 25499       |
| lambda.amazonaws.com | TagResource           | 20673       |
+----------------------+-----------------------+-------------+
```

## Detections as Code with Powerpipe

Pre-built dashboards and detections for the AWS plugin are available in [Powerpipe](https://powerpipe.io) mods, helping you monitor and analyze activity across your AWS accounts.

For example, the [AWS CloudTrail Logs Detections mod](https://hub.powerpipe.io/mods/turbot/tailpipe-mod-aws-cloudtrail-log-detections) scans your CloudTrail logs for anomalies, such as an S3 bucket being made public or a change in your VPC network infrastructure.

Dashboards and detections are [open source](https://github.com/topics/tailpipe-mod), allowing easy customization and collaboration.

To get started, choose a mod from the [Powerpipe Hub](https://hub.powerpipe.io/?engines=tailpipe&q=aws).

## Developing

Prerequisites:

- [Tailpipe](https://tailpipe.io/downloads)
- [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/tailpipe-plugin-aws.git
cd tailpipe-plugin-aws
```

After making your local changes, build the plugin, which automatically installs the new version to your `~/.tailpipe/plugins` directory:

```sh
make
```

Re-collect your data:

```sh
tailpipe collect aws_cloudtrail_log
```

Try it!

```sh
tailpipe query
> .inspect aws_cloudtrail_log
```
