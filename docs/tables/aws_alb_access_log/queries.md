## Activity Examples

### Daily Request Trends

Count requests per day to identify traffic patterns over time. This query helps visualize usage trends, detect potential traffic anomalies, and understand the overall load on your application load balancer across different days.

```sql
select
  strftime(timestamp, '%Y-%m-%d') as request_date,
  count(*) as request_count
from
  aws_alb_access_log
group by
  request_date
order by
  request_date asc;
```

```yaml
folder: ELB
```

### Top 10 Clients by Request Count

List the top 10 client IP addresses making requests. This query helps identify the most active clients, potentially revealing heavy users, bot traffic, or unusual access patterns that might require further investigation.

```sql
select
  client_ip,
  count(*) as request_count
from
  aws_alb_access_log
group by
  client_ip
order by
  request_count desc
limit 10;
```

```yaml
folder: ELB
```

### Request Distribution by Target

Analyze how requests are distributed across target instances. This query provides insights into load balancing effectiveness, helping identify potential bottlenecks or uneven traffic distribution among backend servers.

```sql
select
  target_ip,
  count(*) as request_count
from
  aws_alb_access_log
where
  target_ip is not null
group by
  target_ip
order by
  request_count desc;
```

```yaml
folder: ELB
```

### HTTP Status Code Distribution

Analyze the distribution of HTTP status codes returned by the load balancer. This query helps understand the overall health of your application, identifying success rates, client errors, and server errors.

```sql
select
  elb_status_code,
  count(*) as response_count,
  round(count(*) * 100.0 / sum(count(*)) over (), 3) as percentage
from
  aws_alb_access_log
group by
  elb_status_code
order by
  response_count desc;
```

```yaml
folder: ELB
```

## Detection Examples

### Failed Backend Connections

Identify instances where the load balancer couldn't connect to the backend targets. This query helps detect backend infrastructure issues, network problems, or potential service disruptions.

  and elb_status_code = 502
order by
  timestamp desc;
```

```yaml
folder: ELB
```

### SSL Cipher Vulnerabilities

Detect usage of deprecated or insecure SSL ciphers. This query helps identify potential security risks by highlighting the use of outdated or vulnerable SSL protocols and ciphers.

from
  aws_alb_access_log
where
  ssl_protocol in ('TLSv1.1', 'TLSv1', 'SSLv3', 'SSLv2') -- Insecure protocols (TLSv1.1, TLSv1, SSLv3, SSLv2)
group by
  ssl_cipher,
  ssl_protocol
order by
  request_count desc;
```

```yaml
folder: ELB
```

### Suspicious User Agents

Identify potentially suspicious user agents making requests. This query helps detect potential bot traffic, web scrapers, or automated scanning tools that might be interacting with your application.

```sql
select
  user_agent,
  count(*) as request_count
from
  aws_alb_access_log
where
  user_agent like '%bot%'
  or user_agent like '%curl%'
  or user_agent like '%wget%'
group by
  user_agent
order by
  request_count desc;
```

```yaml
folder: ELB
```

## Operational Examples

### Slow Response Times

  elb,
  tp_index as account_id,
  request_url,
  request_http_method,
  request_http_version,
  client_ip,
  target_ip,
  request_processing_time,  -- Time taken by load balancer to process request
  target_processing_time,   -- Time taken by target to process request
  response_processing_time, -- Time taken to process response
  (request_processing_time + target_processing_time + response_processing_time) as total_time
from
  aws_alb_access_log
where
  (request_processing_time + target_processing_time + response_processing_time) > 1 -- Requests taking longer than 1 second
order by
  total_time desc
limit 10;
```

```yaml
folder: ELB
```

### Target Health Issues

Identify targets that are returning a high number of errors. This query helps detect backend service problems, potential server misconfigurations, or application-level issues affecting specific targets.

```sql
select
  target_ip,
  target_status_code,
  count(*) as error_count
from
  aws_alb_access_log
where
  target_status_code >= 400
group by
  target_ip,
