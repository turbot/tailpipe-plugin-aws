# Table: aws_elb_access_log - Query AWS ELB access logs

The `aws_elb_access_log` table allows you to query AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) access logs. This table provides detailed information about requests processed by your load balancers, including client and target details, processing times, and security parameters.

## Configure

Create a [partition](https://tailpipe.io/docs/manage/partition) for `aws_elb_access_log` ([examples](https://hub.tailpipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/tables/aws_elb_access_log#example-configurations)):

```sh
vi ~/.tailpipe/config/aws.tpc
```

```hcl
connection "aws" "logging_account" {
  profile = "my-logging-account"
}

partition "aws_elb_access_log" "my_elb_logs" {
  source "aws_s3_bucket" {
    connection = connection.aws.logging_account
    bucket     = "aws-elb-logs-bucket"
  }
}
```

## Collect

[Collect](https://tailpipe.io/docs/manage/collection) logs for all `aws_elb_access_log` partitions:

```sh
tailpipe collect aws_elb_access_log
```

Or for a single partition:

```sh
tailpipe collect aws_elb_access_log.my_elb_logs
```

## Query

**[Explore example queries for this table â†’](https://hub.tailpipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/queries/aws_elb_access_log)**

### Failed requests

Find failed HTTP requests (with status codes 400 and above) to troubleshoot load balancer issues.

```sql
select
  timestamp,
  elb,
  client_ip,
  target_ip,
  elb_status_code,
  target_status_code,
  request
from
  aws_elb_access_log
where
  elb_status_code >= 400
order by
  timestamp desc;
```

### Slow response times

Identify requests with high processing times that might indicate performance issues.

```sql
select
  timestamp,
  elb,
  request,
  request_processing_time,
  target_processing_time,
  response_processing_time,
  (request_processing_time + target_processing_time + response_processing_time) as total_time
from
  aws_elb_access_log
where
  (request_processing_time + target_processing_time + response_processing_time) > 1
order by
  total_time desc
limit 10;
```

### SSL cipher usage analysis

Analyze SSL cipher usage patterns across your load balancers.

```sql
select
  ssl_cipher,
  ssl_protocol,
  count(*) as request_count
from
  aws_elb_access_log
where
  ssl_cipher is not null
group by
  ssl_cipher,
  ssl_protocol
order by
  request_count desc;
```

## Example Configurations

### Collect logs from an S3 bucket

Collect ELB access logs stored in an S3 bucket using the default log file format.

```hcl
connection "aws" "logging_account" {
  profile = "my-logging-account"
}

partition "aws_elb_access_log" "my_elb_logs" {
  source "aws_s3_bucket" {
    connection = connection.aws.logging_account
    bucket     = "aws-elb-logs-bucket"
  }
}
```

### Collect logs from an S3 bucket with a prefix

Collect ELB access logs stored in an S3 bucket using a prefix.

```hcl
partition "aws_elb_access_log" "my_elb_logs_prefix" {
  source "aws_s3_bucket" {
    connection = connection.aws.logging_account
    bucket     = "aws-elb-logs-bucket"
    prefix     = "my/prefix/"
  }
}
```

### Collect logs from local files

You can also collect ELB access logs from local files.

```hcl
partition "aws_elb_access_log" "local_logs" {
  source "file"  {
    paths       = ["/Users/myuser/elb_logs"]
    file_layout = "%{DATA}.log.gz"
  }
}
```

### Collect logs for all accounts in an organization

For a specific organization, collect logs for all accounts and regions.

```hcl
partition "aws_elb_access_log" "my_logs_org" {
  source "aws_s3_bucket"  {
    connection  = connection.aws.logging_account
    bucket      = "elb-logs-bucket"
    file_layout = "AWSLogs/o-aa111bb222/%{NUMBER:account_id}/elasticloadbalancing/%{DATA:region}/%{YEAR:year}/%{MONTHNUM:month}/%{MONTHDAY:day}/%{DATA}.log.gz"
  }
}
```
