# Table: aws_s3_server_access_log - Query AWS S3 Server Access Logs

The `aws_s3_server_access_log` table allows you to query AWS S3 Server Access Logs. This table capture detailed request and access information for S3 buckets, helping to analyze access patterns, troubleshoot issues, and enhance security monitoring.

## Configure

Create a [partition](https://tailpipe.io/docs/manage/partition) for `aws_s3_server_access_log` ([examples](https://hub.tailpipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/tables/aws_s3_server_access_log#example-configurations)):

```sh
vi ~/.tailpipe/config/aws.tpc
```

```hcl
connection "aws" "logging_account" {
  profile = "my-logging-account"
}

partition "aws_s3_server_access_log" "my_s3_logs" {
  source "aws_s3_bucket" {
    connection = connection.aws.logging_account
    bucket     = "s3-server-access-logs-bucket"
  }
}
```

## Collect

[Collect](https://tailpipe.io/docs/manage/collection) logs for all `aws_s3_server_access_log` partitions:

```sh
tailpipe collect aws_s3_server_access_log
```

Or for a single partition:

```sh
tailpipe collect aws_s3_server_access_log.my_s3_logs
```

## Query

### Find all failed requests

```sql
select
  timestamp,
  bucket,
  request_uri,
  http_status,
  error_code,
  remote_ip,
  user_agent
from
  aws_s3_server_access_log
where
  http_status is not null
  and http_status >= 400
order by
  timestamp desc;
```

### Identify top 10 users accessing a bucket

```sql
select
  requester,
  count(*) as request_count
from
  aws_s3_server_access_log
where
  bucket = 'test-tailpipe-source-pc'
group by
  requester
order by
  request_count desc
limit 10;
```

### Detect unusually large S3 downloads

```sql
select
  timestamp,
  bucket,
  key,
  bytes_sent,
  remote_ip,
  user_agent
from
  aws_s3_server_access_log
where
  bytes_sent is not null
  and bytes_sent > 50000000 -- 50MB
order by
  bytes_sent desc;
```

## Example Configurations

### Collect logs from an S3 bucket

Collect S3 Server Access logs stored in a S3 bucket 

```hcl
connection "aws" "logging_account" {
  profile = "my-logging-account"
}

partition "aws_s3_server_access_log" "my_s3_logs" {
  source "aws_s3_bucket" {
    connection = connection.aws.logging_account
    bucket     = "s3-server-access-logs-bucket"
  }
}
```

### Collect logs from an S3 bucket with a prefix

```hcl
partition "aws_s3_server_access_log" "my_s3_logs_prefix" {
  source "aws_s3_bucket" {
    connection = connection.aws.logging_account
    bucket     = "s3-server-access-logs-bucket"
    prefix     = "my/prefix/"
  }
}
```
