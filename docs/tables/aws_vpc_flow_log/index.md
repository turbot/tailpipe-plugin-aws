# Table: aws_vpc_flow_log - Query AWS VPC Flow Logs

The `aws_vpc_flow_log` table allows you to query data from [AWS VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html). This table provides detailed insights into network traffic within your VPC, including source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and more.

**Note**: For timestamp information, the `start` field will be used first, with the `end` field as a fallback. If neither field is available, then that log line will not be collected and Tailpipe will return an error.

## Configure

Create a [partition](https://tailpipe.io/docs/manage/partition) for `aws_vpc_flow_log` ([examples](https://hub.tailpipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/tables/aws_vpc_flow_log#example-configurations)):

```sh
vi ~/.tailpipe/config/aws.tpc
```

```hcl
connection "aws" "vpc_logging" {
  profile = "my-vpc-logging"
}

partition "aws_vpc_flow_log" "my_logs" {
  source "aws_s3_bucket" {
    connection = connection.aws.vpc_logging
    bucket     = "aws-vpc-flow-logs-bucket"
  }
}
```

## Collect

[Collect](https://tailpipe.io/docs/manage/collection) logs for all `aws_vpc_flow_log` partitions:

```sh
tailpipe collect aws_vpc_flow_log
```

Or for a single partition:

```sh
tailpipe collect aws_vpc_flow_log.my_logs
```

## Query

**[Explore 12+ example queries for this table â†’](https://hub.tailpipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws/queries/aws_vpc_flow_log)**

### Rejected Traffic

Identify rejected traffic within your VPC.

```sql
select
  start_time,
  src_addr,
  dst_addr,
  protocol,
  action
from
  aws_vpc_flow_log
where
  action = 'REJECT'
order by
  start_time desc;
```

### High-Volume Network Traffic

Identify network interfaces generating high-volume network traffic.

```sql
select
  interface_id,
  count(*) as packet_count,
  sum(coalesce(bytes, 0)) as total_bytes,
  date_trunc('minute', start_time) as event_minute
from
  aws_vpc_flow_log
where
  bytes is not null
group by
  interface_id,
  event_minute
order by
  total_bytes desc;
```

### Top 10 IP Addresses by Request Count

Identify the top 10 source IP addresses that generated the most traffic.

```sql
select
  src_addr,
  count(*) as request_count
from
  aws_vpc_flow_log
where
  src_addr is not null
group by
  src_addr
order by
  request_count desc
limit 10;
```

## Example Configurations

### Collect logs from an S3 bucket

Collect logs stored in an S3 bucket.

If a custom `format` block is not specified for a partition, the table will attempt to detect the log format based on the first line of each file. If the first line doesn't contain a recognizable format, the [fields from the default format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-log-records.html#flow-logs-default) will be used.

```hcl
connection "aws" "vpc_logging" {
  profile = "my-vpc-logging"
}

partition "aws_vpc_flow_log" "my_logs" {
  source "aws_s3_bucket" {
    connection = connection.aws.vpc_logging
    bucket     = "aws-vpc-flow-logs-bucket"
  }
}
```

### Collect logs from an S3 bucket with a prefix

Collect logs stored in an S3 bucket using a prefix.

```hcl
partition "aws_vpc_flow_log" "my_logs_prefix" {
  source "aws_s3_bucket" {
    connection = connection.aws.vpc_logging
    bucket     = "aws-vpc-flow-logs-bucket"
    prefix     = "my/prefix/"
  }
}
```

### Collect logs from an S3 bucket and exclude rejected traffic logs

Use the filter argument in your partition to exclude rejected traffic logs and reduce the size of local log storage.

```hcl
partition "aws_vpc_flow_log" "my_logs_instance" {
  filter = "action != 'REJECT'"

  source "aws_s3_bucket" {
    connection  = connection.aws.vpc_logging
    bucket      = "vpc-flow-logs-bucket"
  }
}
```

### Collect logs from an S3 bucket for a single region

For all accounts, collect logs from `us-east-1`.

```hcl
partition "aws_vpc_flow_log" "my_logs_region" {
  source "aws_s3_bucket"  {
    connection  = connection.aws.vpc_logging
    bucket      = "vpc-flow-logs-bucket"
    file_layout = `AWSLogs/(%{DATA:org_id}/)?%{NUMBER:account_id}/vpcflowlogs/us-east-1/%{YEAR:year}/%{MONTHNUM:month}/%{MONTHDAY:day}/(%{NUMBER:hour}/)?%{DATA}.log.gz`
  }
}
```

### Collect logs from an S3 bucket for multiple regions

For all accounts, collect logs from us-east-1 and us-east-2.

```hcl
partition "aws_vpc_flow_log" "my_logs_region" {
  source "aws_s3_bucket"  {
    connection  = connection.aws.vpc_logging
    bucket      = "vpc-flow-logs-bucket"
    file_layout = `AWSLogs/(%{DATA:org_id}/)?%{NUMBER:account_id}/vpcflowlogs/(us-east-1|us-east-2)/%{YEAR:year}/%{MONTHNUM:month}/%{MONTHDAY:day}/(%{NUMBER:hour}/)?%{DATA}.log.gz`
  }
}
```

### Collect logs from an S3 bucket for a single account

For a specific account, collect logs for all regions.

```hcl
partition "aws_vpc_flow_log" "my_logs_account" {
  source "aws_s3_bucket"  {
    connection  = connection.aws.vpc_logging
    bucket      = "vpc-flow-logs-bucket"
    file_layout = `AWSLogs/(%{DATA:org_id}/)?123456789012/vpcflowlogs/%{DATA:region}/%{YEAR:year}/%{MONTHNUM:month}/%{MONTHDAY:day}/(%{NUMBER:hour}/)?%{DATA}.log.gz`
  }
}
```

### Collect logs from an S3 bucket for all accounts in an organization

For a specific organization, collect logs for all accounts and regions.

```hcl
partition "aws_vpc_flow_log" "my_logs_org" {
  source "aws_s3_bucket"  {
    connection  = connection.aws.vpc_logging
    bucket      = "vpc-flow-logs-bucket"
    file_layout = `AWSLogs/o-aa111bb222/%{NUMBER:account_id}/vpcflowlogs/%{DATA:region}/%{YEAR:year}/%{MONTHNUM:month}/%{MONTHDAY:day}/(%{NUMBER:hour}/)?%{DATA}.log.gz`
  }
}
```

### Collect logs from a CloudWatch log group

Collect logs from all log streams in a CloudWatch log group.

If a custom `format` block is not specified for a partition, the [fields from the default format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-log-records.html#flow-logs-default) will be used.

```hcl
partition "aws_vpc_flow_log" "cw_log_group_logs" {
  source "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" {
    connection     = connection.aws.vpc_logging
    log_group_name = "aws-vpc-flow-logs-123456789012-fd33b044"
    region         = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

### Collect CloudWatch logs with custom format

For VPC flow logs using a [custom format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-log-records.html), you need to define a `format` block that is referenced in the partition.

```hcl
format "aws_vpc_flow_log" "custom" {
  layout = `account-id action az-id bytes dstaddr dstport end flow-direction instance-id interface-id log-status packets pkt-dst-aws-service pkt-dstaddr pkt-src-aws-service pkt-srcaddr protocol region reject-reason srcaddr srcport start sublocation-id sublocation-type subnet-id tcp-flags traffic-path type version vpc-id`
}
```

```hcl
partition "aws_vpc_flow_log" "cw_log_group_logs" {
  source "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" {
    connection     = connection.aws.vpc_logging
    format         = format.aws_vpc_flow_log.custom
    log_group_name = "aws-vpc-flow-logs-123456789012-fd33b044"
    region         = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

### Collect CloudWatch logs using wildcard stream names

Collect logs from a CloudWatch log group where each log stream corresponds to an ENI (Elastic Network Interface).

```hcl
format "aws_vpc_flow_log" "custom" {
  layout = `instance-id interface-id pkt-srcaddr pkt-dstaddr pkt-src-aws-service az-id flow-direction start log-status packets protocol srcaddr dstaddr srcport end subnet-id`
}
```

```hcl
partition "aws_vpc_flow_log" "cw_log_group_logs" {
  source "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" {
    connection       = connection.aws.default
    format           = format.aws_vpc_flow_log.custom
    log_group_name   = "aws-vpc-flow-logs-123456789012-fd33b044"
    log_stream_names = ["eni-*"]
    region           = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

### Collect logs exported from CloudWatch to an S3 bucket

Collect logs that were exported from CloudWatch to an S3 bucket, where the logs do not include a header line. Since the exported logs contain raw log lines only, a format block is defined to map the layout of each field.

**Notes**:
- When logs are **exported from CloudWatch to S3**, they typically **do not include a header line**, so the `format` block becomes **required**. If not specified, a **default format** will be applied.
- The field, `export-timestamp`, is not part of the original log event. It is automatically added by AWS during the export process from CloudWatch to S3. This timestamp represents the time when the log was exported, not when the event occurred.

```hcl
format "aws_vpc_flow_log" "exported_log_format" {
  layout = `export-timestamp instance-id interface-id pkt-srcaddr pkt-dstaddr pkt-src-aws-service az-id flow-direction start log-status packets protocol srcaddr dstaddr srcport end subnet-id`
}
```

```hcl
partition "aws_vpc_flow_log" "cw_log_group_logs" {
  source "aws_s3_bucket" {
    connection = connection.aws.vpc_logging
    format     = format.aws_vpc_flow_log.exported_log_format
    bucket     = "aws-vpc-flow-logs-123456789012-exported"
    region     = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

### Collect logs from local files

You can also collect logs from local files.

```hcl
partition "aws_vpc_flow_log" "local_logs" {
  source "file" {
    paths       = ["/Users/myuser/vpc_flow_logs"]
    file_layout = `%{DATA}.gz`
  }
}
```
