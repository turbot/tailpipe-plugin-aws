## Activity Examples

### Daily Request Trends

Count the number of requests per day to analyze traffic trends over time.

```sql
select
  strftime(timestamp, '%Y-%m-%d') as access_date,
  count(*) as requests
from
  aws_waf_traffic_log
group by
  access_date
order by
  access_date asc;
```

```yaml
folder: WAF
```

### Top 10 Frequently Accessed URIs

Identify the most accessed URIs along with the top client IPs, grouped by the action taken (ALLOW, BLOCK, CHALLENGE, CAPTCHA). This helps in analyzing web traffic and potential security threats.

```sql
select
  terminating_rule_id,
  http_request.clientIp as client_ip,
  http_request.uri as request_uri,
  count(*) as request_count
from
  aws_waf_traffic_log
group by
  terminating_rule_id,
  request_uri,
  client_ip
order by
  request_count desc
limit 10;
```

```yaml
folder: WAF
```

### Analyzing CAPTCHA and Challenge Failures

Analyze the total requests and categorize failures based on CAPTCHA and CHALLENGE response reasons. This helps in assessing the effectiveness of bot mitigation techniques.

```sql
select
  http_request.clientIp as client_ip,
  count(*) as total_requests,

  -- Count of CHALLENGE & CAPTCHA actions
  sum(case when action = 'CHALLENGE' then 1 else 0 end) as challenge_count,
  sum(case when action = 'CAPTCHA' then 1 else 0 end) as captcha_count,

  -- CAPTCHA & CHALLENGE Failure Reasons
  sum(case when captcha_response.failureReason = 'TOKEN_INVALID' then 1 else 0 end) as challenge_token_invalid,
  sum(case when captcha_response.failureReason = 'TOKEN_INVALID' then 1 else 0 end) as captcha_token_invalid,
  sum(case when captcha_response.failureReason = 'TOKEN_DOMAIN_MISMATCH' then 1 else 0 end) as challenge_token_domain_mismatch,
  sum(case when captcha_response.failureReason = 'TOKEN_DOMAIN_MISMATCH' then 1 else 0 end) as captcha_token_domain_mismatch,
  sum(case when captcha_response.failureReason = 'TOKEN_EXPIRED' then 1 else 0 end) as challenge_token_expired,
  sum(case when captcha_response.failureReason = 'TOKEN_EXPIRED' then 1 else 0 end) as captcha_token_expired,
  sum(case when captcha_response.failureReason = 'TOKEN_MISSING' then 1 else 0 end) as challenge_token_missing,
  sum(case when captcha_response.failureReason = 'TOKEN_MISSING' then 1 else 0 end) as captcha_token_missing
from 
  aws_waf_traffic_log
group by 
  client_ip
order by 
  total_requests desc;
```

```yaml
folder: WAF
```

## Operational Examples

### Retrieve Terminating Rule Matched Data for Requests

Extract details of requests that were terminated due to rule matches. This helps in analyzing why a request was blocked or allowed, providing insights into security policies.

```sql
with terminating_rule_match_details as (
  select
    timestamp,
    http_request.clientIp as client_ip,
    http_request.uri as request_uri,
    action,
    unnest(from_json(terminating_rule_match_details, '["JSON"]')) as match_details
  from
    aws_waf_traffic_log
  where
    json_array_length(terminating_rule_match_details) > 0
)
select
  timestamp,
  client_ip,
  request_uri,
  action,
  match_details ->> 'conditionType' as condition_type,
  match_details ->> 'sensitivityLevel' as sensitivity_level,
  match_details ->> 'location' as location,
  match_details ->> 'matchedData' as matched_data
from
  terminating_rule_match_details;
```

```yaml
folder: WAF
```

### Identify Requests Missing Labels

Retrieve requests that do not contain labels, which help in categorizing and identifying the reason for request handling. This is useful for debugging misclassified traffic.

```sql
select
  timestamp,
  action,
  http_request.clientIp as client_ip,
  request_headers_inserted
from
  aws_waf_traffic_log
where
  labels is null
order by
  timestamp;
```

```yaml
folder: WAF
```

### Analyze Blocked Requests by Rule

Retrieve the number of requests blocked by each rule, providing insights into which rules are most frequently triggered. This helps fine-tune security configurations.

```sql
with blocked_rule as (
  select
    timestamp,
    unnest(
      from_json(rule_group_list, '["JSON"]')
    ) as rule_group,
    action,
    http_request
  from
    aws_waf_traffic_log
   where
    action = 'BLOCK'
)
select
  timestamp,
  action,
  http_request.clientIp as client_ip,
  http_request.uri,
  (rule_group -> 'terminatingRule' ->> 'ruleId') as terminating_rule_id,
  (rule_group -> 'terminatingRule' ->> 'action') as terminating_rule_action
from
  blocked_rule;
```

```yaml
folder: WAF
```

### Top 10 Most Targeted URLs

Find the most frequently accessed URLs or endpoints, helping detect high-risk areas in the application. This is useful for mitigating attacks targeting specific endpoints.

```sql
select
  http_source_name,
  http_source_id,
  http_request.uri,
  action,
  count(*) as request_count
from
  aws_waf_traffic_log
group by
  http_source_name,
  http_source_id,
  http_request.uri,
  action
order by
  request_count desc
limit 10;
```

```yaml
folder: WAF
```

## Detection Examples

### Detect Requests with CAPTCHA Failures

Retrieve requests where CAPTCHA validation failed, indicating unsuccessful user verification attempts. This can help detect automated bots attempting to bypass security.

```sql
select
  timestamp,
  http_request.clientIp as client_ip,
  http_request.uri as request_uri,
  action,
  captcha_response.responseCode as response_code,
  captcha_response.solveTimestamp as solve_timestamp,
  captcha_response.failureReason as failure_reason
from
  aws_waf_traffic_log
where
  response_code > 0
  and failure_reason is not null;
```

```yaml
folder: WAF
```

### Detect High Volume of Blocked Requests

Identify IP addresses generating a high volume of blocked requests. This can help detect potential brute-force attacks or malicious traffic sources.

```sql
select
  http_request.clientIp as client_ip,
  count(*) as block_count
from
  aws_waf_traffic_log
where
  action = 'BLOCK'
group by
  client_ip
order by
  block_count desc
limit 10;
```

```yaml
folder: WAF
```

### Detect Requests Triggering Multiple Rules

Find requests that matched multiple non-terminating rules within a single evaluation. This helps in identifying suspicious patterns of traffic.

```sql
select
  timestamp,
  http_request.clientIp as client_ip,
  http_source_name,
  http_source_id,
  json_array_length(non_terminating_matching_rules) as matched_rules
from
  aws_waf_traffic_log
where
  json_array_length(non_terminating_matching_rules) > 1
order by
  matched_rules desc;
```

```yaml
folder: WAF
```

### Detect IP addresses in request headers

Identify web requests where the client IP is present in HTTP headers such as X-Forwarded-For, Client-IP, True-Client-IP, or X-Real-IP. This helps track proxied traffic, potential IP spoofing, or forwarded requests passing through CDN, load balancers, or proxies.

```sql
select
  timestamp,
  http_request.clientIp as client_ip,
  action,
  request_headers_inserted
from
  aws_waf_traffic_log
where
  (request_headers_inserted ->> 'name') in ('X-Forwarded-For', 'Client-IP', 'True-Client-IP', 'X-Real-IP')
  and (request_headers_inserted ->> 'value') is not null
order by
  timestamp desc;
```

```yaml
folder: WAF
```

## Volume Examples

### Analyze High Volume of Blocked Requests

Identify patterns in blocked traffic over time to detect unusual spikes or potential security threats.

```sql
select
  date_trunc('hour', timestamp) as request_hour,
  http_request.clientIp as client_ip,
  http_source_name,
  http_request.uri as request_uri,
  count(*) as block_count
from
  aws_waf_traffic_log
where
  action = 'BLOCK'
group by
  request_hour,
  client_ip,
  http_source_name,
  request_uri
having
  count(*) > 100
order by
  block_count desc;
```

```yaml
folder: WAF
```

### Identify the Most Frequently Triggered Rules

Analyze rules that are most frequently triggered to assess their effectiveness. This helps in refining security rule configurations.

```sql
select
  terminating_rule_id,
  terminating_rule_type,
  count(*) as rule_trigger_count
from
  aws_waf_traffic_log
group by
  terminating_rule_id,
  terminating_rule_type
having
  count(*) > 100
order by
  rule_trigger_count desc;
```

```yaml
folder: WAF
```

## Baseline Examples

### Non-Terminating Rules Matching on SQL Injection

Evaluate rule effectiveness in detecting SQL injection before enforcing stricter rules.

```sql
with not_terminating_rule as (
  select
    timestamp,
    http_request.clientIp as client_ip,
    action,
    unnest(from_json(non_terminating_matching_rules, '["JSON"]')) as rules
  from
    aws_waf_traffic_log
  where
    json_array_length(non_terminating_matching_rules) > 0
)
select
  timestamp,
  client_ip,
  action,
  (rules ->> 'ruleMatchDetails') as rule_match_details
from
  not_terminating_rule
where
  json_contains(rule_match_details, '{"conditionType": "SQL_INJECTION"}');
```

```yaml
folder: WAF
```
