### Explanation of Issues:
1. **SQL Syntax Checks**:
   - **Indentation**: The query does not follow the required 2 space indentation.
   - **Clause format**: Each SQL clause should be on its own line for better readability.
   - **Column names**: The columns `operation` and `user_agent` do not exist in the provided schema, leading to a failure in this check.
  
2. **Query Title and Description Checks**:
   - **Title accuracy**: The title does not reflect the exact functionality of the query, which is to list unauthenticated requests.
   - **Description**: The description could be made more concise and should clearly state the purpose and usefulness of the query.
